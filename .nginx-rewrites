## Put these configs in your server configuration if you are using nginx, (for example sites-available/default) to enable rewriting of queries.
#Obviously you might need to modify them a bit, but i decided to include these anyway, so you can get the picture.

# The above rules are supposed to rewrite like this:
#
# root/metal-pet/home/is/here/
#  to
# root/metal-pet/index.php?p=home&p1=is&p2=here
# 
# root/metal-pet/index.php then handles page-requests (As a front controller).
# Should work with or without trailing slash
